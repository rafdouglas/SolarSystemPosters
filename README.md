# SolarSystemPosters
A series of A4-posters of the Solar system. 
Suitable for the primary school.
Full color, printable, modifiable.

There are 10 A4 cards, one per planet (yes, there is also Pluto ;) ) and one for the Sun.

You can either use the ready-to-print 150dpi pdf, or modify the odg (with [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)) to suit it to your needs/language.
